  '      and have been downloaded  or that local finals have been set ..
  '  other changes:
  '    Tried to Fix the 1st textbox error in Judges Scores Entry when empty data bases but counld not

  '        test when open from Judges Scores Entry
  '
  '
  '
  '  Rev 5.5.6   Started by Dennis  6-8-14
  '    Converted SciFairMaster to Access 2002-2003 format (was 2000) so can work with Source Control
  '        program AccessSVN (future?)
  '    Added Access Version in Startup window
  '    Renamed form xBackup SERC Data to xBackup All Data
  '
  '  Rev 5.5.5 Started 06 5 2014
  '   A few minor changes logged as 5.5.4a working with empty tablea and the distribution website.
  '
  '  Rev 5.5.4 Started 05/29/14 by Dennis  DES
  '    Emptied most data files in scifairdata and scifairwebdata in order to test for errors when starting
  '    from scratch with empty data tables.  Changes to fix found problems in these and other items:
  '      Form xWebSite Sync,  Form xSciFairWebdata Users Form xExhibit Edit Add Delete, Function SearchDuplicatePersons
  '      SchoolsEditAddDelete (form only),module Functions Function GetNextAvailJUN(),
  '      form swebsite sync Sub CmdUpdtJudges_Click(),
  '    In Form Startup in Form_Load.  Added a test for size of SciFairData in order to allert user to
  '     do a Compact and Repair to lower size when SciFair Data Grows by 2 Mb. (And a reminder to compact SciFairWebdata)
  '     Set SciFairDataMaxSize property to 2 Mbyt in the very last step of Fair Maintenence to force a
  '      Compact on next startup.
  '
  '
  
  '  Rev 5.5.3
  '     Start of changes to apply the GNU license to the application -in anticipation of allowing free distributions
  '        and allowing others to distribute the solution if they follow the GNU license terms.
  '     Added Form License
  '     Modified Startup Form
  '     Added this module (History) and the module License.
  '
  '
  '  Rev 5.5.2     Search for 552 or 5.5.2   (DES indicates Dennis did change)
  '      Dennis.  Closed the scores dataset when closing the Judge Scores Entries Form  (probably not requried??)
  '        Notice the Scores dataset used in Judge Socres Entries stays open the entire time the form is open. This could be improved
  '        since is not a good idea.  should open it each time used and close it when done so it is closed while the form is setting idle.
  '      Dennis.  Modified xSciFairWebData Users utility to also look at SciFairData users.
  '               Added test in Startup form  to check if website FairYear has been set correctly (so users do not forget)
  '
  '    **********STILL NEED TO DO (or check) ***************
  '
  '        * Sometimes SciFairData and SciFairWebData stay locked  (The .idb file exists)  This is usually caused by some table
  '          or query being left open in the code of SciFairMaster or in one of the website forms (Chairs ranking WS etc).
  '        NOTE:  the form xSciFairWebdata Users can possibly help
  '        NEED to to tests and search the code to see if we leave any open.  Usually, when a form is closed all the open data sets are
  '           closed but maybe not.  In any case this has been an illusive bug since way back.
  '        * teamwork in reports (need to check script and other reports to see if they handle teamwork correctly - probably not an issue),
  '
  '  Rev   5.5.1   Search for 551 and/or 5.5.1 (DES indicated Dennis did change)
  '
  '     *  IsTeam (in exhibit) for now (2014++) is used for scoring only to select the criteria from Categories / SForm union.
  '             See the ExhScore  code on how this works.
  '     * DES  I fixed the events for the CR1 thru CR6  in Form_xJudge Scores Entry Subform.  They were broken when the envent names
  '         in the code were changed but not in the form (Design View)  This broke the fix to update the scores when the marks are changed
  '         in the subform
  '     * In Judges Scores Entry reports  (and the generation of status) the note "Invalid: No Score Forms" should read:
  '        "No Complete Score Forms" or something like that - this was changed in ExhScore subroutine
  '     * Updated the Forms on the web to reflect the new changes to scoring criteria and other tweaks.  Search for 5.5.0 or 550 in the web cs code
  '     * Changed the column names for exhibitJudges table on the server to be  CR1,CR2...CR6   Had forgotten to do that
  '     * The judges marks button in the Page "judge chair ranking form" on the website were fixed to work by
  '        redoing the pop up page SecChairFormScoreDetail.aspx and the cs code for that page.
  '        the criteria in the form were the old ones.
  '        Updated to use the Category table and Sform table to get the titles for the popup using SciFairData.
  '
  '   Rev 5.5.0   **  starting tweaks and bug fixes from rev 5.4.9  ***
  '      12/20/13  Dennis modified form Categories Manager (edit Add Delete) to add selection drop down boxes for scoring criteria
  '                Created a new form xScoring Criteria  and placed it into the Judges Group
  '                Changed the allowable values for TmCritNum (team Criteria Number) to include 0 so can have an entry to select in Categories Manager.
  '
  '   Rev 5.4.9
  '     More changes to accomodate new score forms.  Search for 5.4.9 and 549 to find changes.
  '     Dennis tried to get all the changes made by Chelsea into this revision using the 2003 format .mdb
  '     Dennis modified table SForm to add the FairYr field. This so can link into the scoreformpreslug query
  '     Dennis added the global parameters Public CRWeight(80,6) As Double  at top of functions module
  '     Dennis added code in ExScore to fill in the global parameters from SForm and to verify the data.
  '        Note: there must always be only one record in SForm and
  '           the weights must add up to 100    Checks make sure all that is true.
  '
  '     Dennis changed the structure of table SForm and  Tab;e Categories to  allow for a different criteria set for each NCAT.
  '      Each NCAT can have it's own unique criteria set (record in SForm) and optionally a criteria set if the NCAT Exhibit is a team.
  '       To make this work:
  '       Added a CritNum (required , >0 < 40)-non-team criteria...  and TmCritNum (Required  0 or > 40 and < 80  Default 0) team members to Categories table
  '          changed the globals CRWeight(80,6) to hold up to 39 criteria for team and for non-teams (if applicable).
  '          changed the  ExhScore function to allow for all of this. .
  '     Dennis modified the query  xScoreFormsPreSlug  to include the descriptions of the criteria for printing
  '       (Also did a first cut on the MS Word document to work with the new forms.)
  '     New xScoreFormsPreSlug query and word doc will print weights and descriptions as applicable for the exhibits NCAT and
  '       if applicable the exhibits NCAT Team criteria.  This should allow for more flexibility  anything in the future.
  
  '   Rev 5.4.8
  '     Start of mods by Chelsea for the new score forms and score critera
  '     Added table SForms to SciFair Data - this will hold the criteria data and can be modified in future without changing code.
  '     Changes to Function ExhScore by Chelsea  labeled  5.4.8 or 548
  '     Changes by Dennis  labeled 5.4.8DES or 548DES
  '     Dennis changed the "names" in the form xJudges Scores Entry Subform using Design mode.  Chelsea already did the data boxes.
  '     Dennis added Public CRWeight and CRDesc (see top of this code) needed to save scoring criteria so do not open data table over and over
  '   Rev 5.4.7 Search for "5.4.7"   Incorporate new scoring criteria (no more separate teamwork score) and fix some bugs
  '    Fix bugs in Form_Startup:
  '     cleaned up messages (and bug) if set year ahead and have not run Fair Maintenance
  '     Fixed bug that caused infinite loop when change fair year and SciFairData not linked
  '    Fixed issue if change a mark in subform for xJudge Scores Entry subform, then the scores were not updated
  '      User can click the update score button  -but if forget then ExScore(exn) is never called, even if
  '      Updatewebscores is done. Thus the exibit's score is never updated to relflect the changes.  This is fix
  '      in xJudgeScoresEntry  Made Sub btnRecalculateScore_Click() Public  so can call from subform (also changed
  '          some messages to be more clear.
  '      in xJudgeScoresEntrySubform, add call to btnRecalcualteScore_Click() for each scoremark change after update
  '          Thus that click calles ExScore(exn) for the exhibit changed.
  '    Added enhancement to help user select folder for scores data import and where the studentdata.csv file is stored
  '        changes in btnImport and btnBuildStuData  in xJudgeScoresEntry.
  '        Try X:\1_Application_Scoring_Etc\Scoring\ else X:\App_Data   where X: is the mapped drive for SciFairData.mdb
  '    Form FairInfo Edit Add Delete.
  '       create the form's code by clicking on the useteamwork for properties and setup onclick event for code
  '       Form load  set useteamworkmark true  (sets it true in the database)
  '       msg box to remind if click on useteamwork  will always be set
  '
  '    In Judge Scores Entry, btnImport  (import scores)  I added some code to check if we have missed
  '       reading a score file.  I check the first sequence number in the file being read, then
  '       search all the files starting with "Imp"  (I.E. already imported) to find the previous sequence number.
  '       This is because in 2013 we missed importing two files that were placed in the wrong folder after
  '         a power failure of the router.  Human error but... this will check in future.
  '       This does not seem to take much time when the files are local.  not sure how long it will take with
  '         mapped files.
  '
  '  *Scoreing weights will now be the same for all prjects but teamwork will always be used in score
  '    Subroutine ExhScore()
  '       Force useteamwork to always be true with a test.
  '        Removed or fixed checks re teamwork and changed code for new scores weighting for 2014 on
  '    We Must set all exibits as team exhibits when create studentdata.csv  to force checks on that mark
  '          This is all in the ID in the xScoreFormsPreSlug  query.  so fix it there then the code to create the file
  '            works since the code uses the preslug query
  '       Done! in xScoreFormsPreSlug  query, changed ID to ID-Old just to save for future (not used now)
  '       ALSO:  (xScoreFormsPreSlug  query)
  '          Added new ID in xScoreFormsPreSlug  query so first digit is always '2'  thus forcing
  '                 scanner to always check and record the marks in old teamwork  (now interview)
  '          Added new IsEngr field to xScoreFormsPreSlug  query This is where any changes should be
  '             made to select which NCAT are Engineering (the rest will be Research)   (See desing mode for query)
  '          Renamed Cksum to cksum-old and built a new CKsum for first digit of barcode always = 2
  '          Renamed Barcode to Barcode-old and built new barcode with first digit always = 2
  '
  '   Still IN WORK:
  '
  '
  '   Rev 5.4.6 started 3-11-2012  finished 3-20-12 (Search for 5.4.6   or for 546 to find changes.
  '     Fixed  two bugs found in 2012 fair:
  '      1. The number of no shows increased sometime as we processed scores ("N" placed in ExhibitsData table "To_State"
  '          without intention.
  '        Probably cause: Someone ran the utility xSet To_state/ISEF first two buttons before all cats were final
  '           (probably trying to change the  number of exhibits allocated to go to state.)
  '      2. The Category Ranking printout in JudgeScores Form showed  Y  in Final to state when there should
  '          prior to setting the finals.  - without intention.
  '         Probable cause:
  '           a.  MasterChair had logged onto the page to set Final To State and clicked
  '                the button to set finals to state to the Chairs Suggested to state numbers.. followed by
  '           b. Someone Then ran the utility xSet To_state/ISEF first two buttons before all cats were final
  '              (probably trying to change the  number of exhibits allocated to go to state. -I.E. same as bug 1.
  '     Solution:  Better warning message on the Utility and checks if all final etc.
  '             see the many code changes in xSet To_State/ISEF  form.
  '     Other clean up:
  '        Cleared TOC in ExhibitsData when clear all scores  (JudgeScores Entry)
  '        Judges Score Entry:
  '          enabled hourglass when clear Exhibits data
  '          Made progress bar blink when doing checks when clear Web Exibits data
  '          Clear TOC and To_State entries in SciFairData.ExhibitsData table when clear all scores
  '          checked for OK location of SciFairWebData.mdb on form open - warn operator to fix if in error.
  '          When clear finals category, also clear local ExhibitData.TOC and..
  '           Clear the SciFairWebData NatCategories.InputFinal field
  '             This forces the Chair to make Final Again before it is available for download.
  '        WebSiteSync.  cleaned up some messages etc.
  '        Backup SERC Data - some clean up but mainly fixed issue that would not backup Website data if
  '           located in a different place than SciFairData.
  '
  '  Rev 5.4.5  started 11022011  (wow backwards that is 11022011)  Finished 3-11-2012

  '     Updated the help file to better describe the Apperson Data Link install, and usage.
  '
  '  5.4.4  Any changes required for 2012 fair.
  '   Cleaned messages in Fair Maintenance, Website sync and other minor changes.
  '   Changed backup utility to include SciFairWebData and the SQL backupset
  '     rules.   scifairdata.mdb must be on web in App_Data.  Sql backupset must be in App_Data\Backup folder
  '              i.e.  web setup as of 10-31-2011 after sql backup was implemented.
  '
  '  5.4.3  Bugs in 2011 fair
  '    Added Website Cleanup to FairMaintenance form with option to create practice data.
  '    Fixed xAwardWGroup Sub Form to allow award numbers > 320 Changed Integer to Long

  '      a check ClearCat was <> "" in form xWebSiteSync  ( only if <> "" does it clear Override.)
  '    JudgesScoresEntry:  fixed report name so can print 'all' category reports
  '    Website: fixed so ISEF votes can be edited and changed.  Added comments and colored buttons
  '    Added utility xSciFairWebData Users
  '     (had to add a Reference in VB to 'Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.8 Library' for this to work)
  '    Aded notes etc. to explain if we change the to-state allocations AFTER we clear scores and have
  '      started scanning - that the new to_state allocations are uploaded to the website each time
  '      we do an upload of scores to the website.
  '
  '  5.4.2

  '   * Modified x Award Donor Post Fair Report so each donor gets a report and to eliminate the duplicate
  '     student lisings (caused by wrong grouping): Group by award name (no fields in that group

  '      XJudges Scores Entry Form
  '        Added Status listing (lists status of all categories)
  '        Changed Printing for category All to print every 'individutal' category listing
  '      Changed Report xCategory Exhibit Ranking Report to take 'Tag' from Judges Scores Entry form

  '         Judges have been assigned to the exhibit
  '         And..  to at the same time allow operator to input the new exhibit number.
  '      New xScoreFormsPreSlug Query Had to format CheckSum to "00" because some IDs require 2 digits
  '           Then, that change execeded the length of the query statement of the field BarCode so.
  '           I had to split the BarCode to two parts
  '           Field BarCode - all characters up to the '/' before checksum
  '           Field CKSum   - the '/' and the formated checksum  Format(cksum,"00")
  '         Note: You can NOT use one query colum's results in another query column as a mail merge source
  '               It ends up there is no data in the column that uses another column's results.
  '       Changes in exhibits edit add delete:  (trying to fix some issue in deleting when there are
  '           messed up records after Import Exhibits created duplicates and incorrect structure
  '           in exhibit students etc. FIXED - Staff used xExhibits Edit Add Delete QUERY to delete
  '          exhibits.  This left Records in ExhibitJudges, ExhibitStudents(F_ORD = 2,3,..)
  '           and ExhibitData since deleteing using the query only deleted record in
  '           ExhibitStudents where F_ORD = 1  I deleted the 'query' and used the same query but built
  '           into the ExhibitEditAddDelete form.   Now they will have to use the form to delete exhibits.
  '  5.2.3   Added Requeries to several recordsets in CmdExh() so that finds duplicates
  '          that were added in previous loop run.  (in the loop)
  '          That prevents DUPLICATES created in a single RUN.
  '          If two team records and names match exactly, then the second record simply
  '            replaces the first record.
  '          Rev 5.2.2 would still create duplicates if multiple records with
  '          same lastname firstname.
  '         Added checks for the word team in Update Categories in form web sync
  '           now I can use the word team to selectively load the cat dropdown boxes
  '            on the web site and know it will alwas work on team or not team.
  '         added two versions of build Student Database for short or long data
  '           in Judge Scores Entry form.
  '  5.2.2   Work to allow reimport of exhibits without creating duplicate entries.
  '           Also need to rework web site so that teams can only select team categories
  '           and Individual exhibits can not select team categories. (after this rev done)
  '  5.2.1   Added code so reimport of Team Exhibits works with origional Exhbit Number
  '           Minor clean up of code
  '  5.2.0   Added to xWeb Sync - "update judges" now puts all judge data on the web
  '  5.1.0,5.0.1 Started 01-13-09   Bug fixes from 5.0.0 and other as follows:
  '         Clean up misc messages other non critical stuff (Search for 5.0.1)
  '         Added ADDR2 to Web Judgesdata and Address2 Judges Form
  '         Change form xWeb Import to xWebSite Sync.
  '           Added Categories, Judge dropdownlist (Judges table) Schools and Teachers updates.
  '         (updates  data in Web site to match local SciFairData)
  '         Started Judge Data load to for judge form and synchronization in xWebSie Sync
  '         (Work commented out prior to deployment or 5.1.0)
  '         Add import of 'MINOR' and Address2 from web to local
  '  5.0.0  After many many itterations of 4.0.4 5.0.0 is delivered version of 4.0.4 final
  '         Supports Web data imports (From Stem Website)
  '         Supports Apperson BenchMark3000 Scanner and DataLink Exports
  '         Supports Team Categories (not team exhibits in any category)
  '         Does Not support team projects in any category
  '         Removed use of ComCtl32.ocx - use api version so is compatible with VISTA
  '  4.0.4  Started Sept 2008:
  ' Notdone? Update judgescores entry form to clean up and modify
  '             for Apperson BenchMark3000 scanner.
  '  Notdone? Plan to Move Peter Luceros queries, code, tables used  to move data from web site
  '             to scifairdata.mdb
  '             Updated and fixed some of the code
  '         Removed the Judges score entry form with category notes (done)
  '         Removed the Judges score entry from with cantegory notes subform  (done)
  '  ---------------
  '  ??     for 2007 fair, Peter Lucero provided code etc to import data from the
  '         website to SciFairData.  He used his version of SciFairMaster with new
  '         forms, queries, and code.
  '         He added some tables to SciFairMaster (his version only)
  '           TID_on_Web_But_Not_on_SciFi
  '           xExhibits Students Data QRY1  not sure what this was..
  '                perhaps to find team students ??
  '           TblWebDbPath (not sure if he used this one or the one in SciFairData or both?
  '           JunNbrs  (not sure ... same as above in both places?)
  '        He also added two tables to SciFairData.mdb
  '           TblWebDbPath (attached disc drive and database name)
  '           JunNbrs  (holds temporary or?? available judge numbers ?)
  '   ---------------
  '  ?? 4.9.4 Tried some work with a notes (type memo) field in judge scores Entry.
  '        This wasy was abandoned.
  '  4.0.3 After 2008 fair: Fixed a problem in import judges scores .  see detail in 4.0.3
  '  4.0.2  no record of code changes probably just some form tweeks or new forms etc.
  '  4.0.1 Revision Staff has used until Dec 2008. (no record of code changes
  '  4.0.0  No record of code changes, but the 2008 fair reverted to using NCAT Team
  '         Also in this year we used scantron scanners. so I added the judge scores entry
  '         form and reports so we did not have to use SFData - the old standby used to
  '         read cards using the HP card readers.
  '  3.?.?  Not sure there were any changes for but p
  '  2.4.x + No Team Cats! TeamField in Exhibits table. for 2007 fair, there was a series of revisions
  '          that allowed any category to have team exhbits but no NCAT Team.
  '           any category instead of STeam and JTeam. i.e. 'No Team Cats'  These were abandoned.
  '  2.3.4.1 or 2.3.41 or 2.3.x  The last revision before TeamCats were removed
